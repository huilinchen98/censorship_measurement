'''This test measures the number of different response code for selenium and Urllib.
We group all the responses into 4 categories: 200, timeout, error and Other. 200 means
the status code we got is 200ã€‚ Other means we got the reponses code but it's not 200. Timeout
means the access exceeded the time limit we set. Error means the access throws eror by Selenium
or Urllib.

 We are using 2 kinds of recording Formats, called matched pairs and full randomization
 For the first, matched pairs, we randomized the sequence of using Selenium and urllib.
 We repeated this randomized pair 3 times. The second one, full randomization,
 we randomized the 6 accesses, 3 for urllib and 3 for Selenium.
 For each of the tests mentioned below we run it in both of these two formats to see
 if we find any major difference.

NOTE: since I didn't put the functions into a class, it might be easier to understand
if reading the functions from bottom to top. I'm sorry for the inconvience
